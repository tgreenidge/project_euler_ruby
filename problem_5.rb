# 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

# What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

#Greatest common factor of 1 through 20

# any number divisible by 20 is also divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20
# Prime numbers up to 20  not accounted for already 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19

#20 = 2*2*5


puts 2 * 2* 3 * 20 * 19 * 17 * 13 * 11 * 7 * 3

#I need to put together code to solve this, although I know how it is solved in my head!!
